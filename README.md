Hi there!

I am a postdoctoral researcher interested in **Bayesian statistics**. Here’s a bit about me:

- 🎓 **Academic Focus**: I delve deep into all topics related to Bayesian statistics, including Bayesian computation and asymptotic properties. My research often merges theoretical frameworks with practical applications.
- 💻 **Tech Savvy**: Passionate about both traditional methods (like pencil and paper) and modern technology. I enjoy programming, especially for web development and customizing devices!
- 🏊‍♂️ **Personal Interests**: When I’m not crunching numbers, I love swimming, exploring photography, and programming.

I'm always open to collaborate on projects or discuss anything Bayesian. Feel free to reach out!
