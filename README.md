Hi there!
I am a Ph.D. student studying [Bayesian statistics at Department of Statistics, Seoul National University](https://snubayes.org).

I have been studying all topics related to Bayesian statistics, such as Bayesian computation and asymptotic properties.
I love studying with a computer as well as pencel and paper!

I enjoy swimming, photography, and programming (especially web and tweak for my devices, which is far from my major ðŸ˜„).
